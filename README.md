Some mods I edited/wrote:
## FailedRecipesFix
A fix for the [Failed Recipes do not consume Ingredients](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/131) mod that uses the BepInEx Configuration Manager instead of Shared Mod Config Menu or a custom parser (which was probably the cause for the long loading times).

## RagdollCannon
A mod that allows to launch the player character as a ragdoll through the air. Kinda like the Totally Accurate Battlegrounds ragdolling. Good for quickly getting from point A to B.
Also quite cheaty as you can ignore weight limitations and glitch through (invisible) walls and barriers.
