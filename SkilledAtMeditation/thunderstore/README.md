Allows players to slowly regenerate stats by meditating.

### What makes this different from <other sitting regen mod>?
- Gives the player a skill to meditate instead of relying on some key set in the config (therefore also allowing gamepad users to use this)
- Gives the player a visible status effect
- Regenerates all burnt and active stats with options to customize this

### Changelog:
1.0.1:
- Reduce default burnt stat regeneration
