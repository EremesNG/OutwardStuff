**Custom Animations/Replacing the AnimatorController** The animations are controlled through a AnimatorController ([https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animations.AnimatorController.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animations.AnimatorController.html "https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Animations.AnimatorController.html")) So we have to replace or edit that one to add our own states and transitions (editing can be a bit difficult as the transitions aren't reachable rn afaik) Replacing the animator with your own is pretty straight forward On the code side we basically just import the AssetBundle (with `AssetBundle.LoadFromFile(path).LoadAllAssets()`) and then replace `animator.runtimeAnimatorController` with our animator ([https://github.com/exp111/OutwardStuff/blob/master/AnimationTest/AnimationTest.cs](https://github.com/exp111/OutwardStuff/blob/master/AnimationTest/AnimationTest.cs "https://github.com/exp111/OutwardStuff/blob/master/AnimationTest/AnimationTest.cs")) To create a valid asset bundle i used ThunderKit ([https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit "https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit"), but you can do this with only unity too afaik) The README is a good guide but basically create a manifest with a AssetBundleDefs, add your objects to that and then use a pipeline to stage the assetbundles. I tried exporting the game's animator controller (from `resources.assets`) with a few tools but only utinyRipper exported a .controller (which is a yaml file), but that one was missing transitions So we either need a better exporter/dumper, manually fix the exported one or create a custom controller from scratch (which may take some time as the 
default one has quite a few states)


## Exporters:
uTinyRipper: https://github.com/mafaca/UtinyRipper, can export but doesn't contain all transitions, no longer dev'ed
AssetRipper: https://github.com/ds5678/AssetRipper, seems promising, is being dev'ed
DevX-Unpacker: https://devxdevelopment.com/Unpacker, paid, didn't find a crack
AssetStudio: https://github.com/RaduMC/AssetStudio, doesn't export animation controllers, no longer being dev'ed
