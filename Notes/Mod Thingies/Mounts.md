### Technical
Mounts as items (whistles) or skills (various pro cons)
WoW Style summoning (use to summon and ride, when attacked force dismount, use again to unsummon)
No mount inventory => maybe carry bonus (as the animal carries you)
Mount summon needs like 2-3 seconds to prevent abuse

### Content
Common mounts progressionwise from special skill trainers
Rare mounts dropped from enemies (rare drop) or bosses (less rare) => More rarer = more speed/health/special abilities (attack/jump?)
Traders sell mounts (one in each city?)
Mount is the "regional animal" (chersonesse = pearlbird)
Quests:
- Czierzo: Hurt pearlbird for doing favour (starting mount, worse than bought ones)
- Egg (sold or through quest) that needs to be bred
- Evolve mounts by crafting/npc
