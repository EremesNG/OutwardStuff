Removes time limits (in main or side quests) and optionally skips timers (ie between the main quests).

This does not remove the main quest progression restriction on parallel quests (meaning that if you reach the 3rd main quest, you will still fail the parallel quest, excluding the Sorobean one).

If you notice anything that I missed, create an issue on github.
