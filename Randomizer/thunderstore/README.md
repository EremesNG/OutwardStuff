Randomizes item drops and such.
A list of things that are randomized:
- Treasure Chests and other containers like junk piles
- Enemy drops
- Enemy armor and weapons
- Merchant inventories
- Gatherables like berry bushes or mining spots

You can enable/disable most stuff in the config. Changes won't be made directly but rather on an area reload/merchant refresh/respawn.
